# NYT

This was a group project from July 2018.  I worked with Andrew Harding, Izaak M, and John Kerr.  John and myself worked on the front end with the Bootstrap framework for semantic markup and CSS styling. Andrew and Izaak worked on the back end with the jQuery framework for calling a New York Times API with JavaScript.
